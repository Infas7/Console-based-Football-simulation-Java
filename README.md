<h3>Football game simulation</h3>

<p>Football is a world famous game where two teams are playing against each other to send the ball to
the opposition side goal. Each team has 11 to 18 players. One player is positioned as goalie and he
prevents the ball pass into the goal area. Each team has a one couch and one doctor.
In the football ground, there is a main referee and four referees in the four edges of the ground. The
game will play two 45-minute period, which is known as half (first half and second half). There is a
15 minute break between the two halves.</p>
<p>If both teams unable to achieve a goal or scored equal number of goals, then the game will be played
for another two of 15 minutes periods after the second half. Even then the goals at that extra time,
then 5 opportunities to shoot the ball to the goal is given to each team. The team who scored most
out of five chances will win the game.</p>
<p>The team to play first is chosen by tossing a coin.Regular rules taken place in football game is
applied in this game as well.In this project, penalty issuing process which is taken place in actual
game is ignored.</p>

Once the game started, the score board indicates
 <ul> 
<li>Names of two teams</li>
<li>Number of goals in each team</li>
<li>Last goal played by whom</li>
<li>Period of the game : first half / interval / second half / extra time / penalty shots to end the game</li>
<li>Time to end the game</li>
</ul>
In addition, it also display current status of the game. i. e.
<ul>
<li>Name and the team of the player who has the ball</li>
<li>Name and the team of the player who received the ball once it is passed</li>
<li>The ball out of the field or in the field</li>
<li>Whether the ball goes to the goal area or stopped by the goalie</li>
</ul>
<p>
The game is developed using the object oriented concepts. All the players, couches, referees, and
doctors are considered as person. The ball, football ground, goal area,and scoreboard are considered
as objects. Number of goals played by each player needed to be recorded and kept in playersâ€™ records
as well. The UML class diagram  is included with the files.Once the game is started, it should automatically update the score board.</p>
<i>Hint:Assign a probability value of achieving a goal to each player and goal preventing
probability to the goalie. A randomly generated number can be used with the probability value to
decide whether there is a goal or not. This can be extend to decide whether the ball is passed to the
team mate successfully or not, ball goes out of the field or not, who receives the ball and etc. In
addition, No need to consider penalties</i>
